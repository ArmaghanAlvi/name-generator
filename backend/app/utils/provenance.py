"""Wordnet provenance registry — the single source of truth for which edge
provenances come from a wordnet, and what each one is allowed to do.

Three consumers previously kept independent lists and had to agree:
  * importers/wordnet_lmf.py       --provenance argparse choices
  * services/parallel_expansion.py pivot eligibility (zero wordnet edges)
  * services/sense_embeddings.py   which edges feed embedding TEXT
Two of the three failed SILENTLY when a provenance was missing. One list,
two explicit exclusion sets, no silent disagreement.

Adding a wordnet (Stage 5 of the pre-import roadmap): add it to
WORDNET_PROVENANCES, then decide whether it belongs in either exclusion set.
Both decisions are deliberate; neither has a safe default.
